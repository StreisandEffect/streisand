This script installs Streisand builder dependencies into an isolated
Python virtualenv. A virtualenv is one of the most reliable ways of
avoiding version clashes, and is especially recommended for people
having problems with initial Streisand installs.

Note that this script is not guaranteed to work for localhost
deployments. This will be fixed in a later release.

It depends on Python 2.7, and on a pip command functional enough to
install virtualenv.  If this is a system running Debian or Ubuntu,
this script will also check for other packages needed to install.

This script can install virtualenv for you, but on Linux, this
requires sudo/root access.

'new-directory' must be somewhere you can write to. A good place may be
$HOME/streisand-deps.
