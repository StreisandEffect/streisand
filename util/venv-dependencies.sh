Usage: $0 ./venv

This script creates an isolated Python virtualenv at './venv', and
installs Ansible and dependencies into it.

The script depends on Python 2.7, and on a functional 'pip' command.
This script can install 'virtualenv' for you, but this may require
sudo/root access.

If this system is running Debian or Ubuntu, this script will also
check for other packages needed to install.

Although './venv' is recommended, you can specify another location to
create the virtualenv. If the location already exists, it should be an
existing virtualenv to overwrite.
