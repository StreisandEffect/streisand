# Uncomment the following lines and update the IP address if you would
# like to use Streisand to configure a server that is already running
# (e.g. a server at a provider not natively supported by Streisand).
#
# Multiple servers can be configured simultaneously if multiple IP
# addresses are defined.
#
# If you already have SSH fingerprints for the hosts you are configuring
# (e.g. using `ssh-keyscan`) then you should also comment out the
# 'host_key_checking = False' line in the ansible.cfg file. That setting
# is only sensible and convenient when connecting to a brand-new host.

# If the SSH user to be used to login is not "root", specify it here with
# the ansible_user directive. Streisand will sudo automatically. If sudo
# requires a password, use the --ask-become-pass command line option.
