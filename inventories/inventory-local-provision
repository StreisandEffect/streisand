# inventory-local-provision is a pre-built inventory file useful for doing an
# advanced local install of Streisand where the server running Ansible is the
# server that will be configured.

# Settings for the provisioning process
[localhost]

# This must specify the Python interpreter when provisioning, because
# "python" may be in, for example, a virtualenv without python-apt.
localhost ansible_connection=local ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python

# Settings for the Streisand host that will be provisioned
[streisand-host]
# If you need to override the name of the server (e.g. because the system
# hostname is not the desired server name for documentation/etc) then add a host
# var named "streisand_server_name" with the desired value.
localhost ansible_connection=local streisand_noninteractive=true
