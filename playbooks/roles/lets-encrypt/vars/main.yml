# Currently Let's Encrypt does not provide a range of IP addresses they are
# connecting from, so we have to open 80/tcp to the entire Internet. If they
# provide a white list in the future, like BitBucket does, we can use the white
# list here.

# However, currently the only thing that listens on 80/tcp is an ACME
# challenge-response server (acmetool redirector mode) so this may not be a big
# concern right now.
