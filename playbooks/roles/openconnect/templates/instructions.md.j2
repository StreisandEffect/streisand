OpenConnect / Cisco AnyConnect
------------------------------

OpenConnect is an extremely high-performance and lightweight VPN server that also features full compatibility with the official Cisco AnyConnect clients. The [protocol](http://www.infradead.org/ocserv/technical.html) is built on top of standards like HTTP, TLS, and DTLS, and it's one of the most popular and widely used VPN technologies. Due to its use among large multi-national corporations, it often means that at the protocol level, it is seldom targetted for censorship.

#### Prompted for username? ####

Some users [have reported](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand/issues/847) that their Android AnyConnect clients prompt for a username and password. This is a known bug we don't understand. See the list of [Streisand AnyConnect open issues](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20anyconnect). If you're affected, you could help us understand the bug by reporting your details using the issue list's *New issue* button's template. Fixes are gratefully accepted too.

If you're affected, you can use this workaround:

1. When prompted for a user, enter `streisand`
1. When prompted for a password, use `{{ ocserv_password.stdout }}`
