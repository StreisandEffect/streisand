# tl;dr: increase vpn_clients beyond 20 at your own risk.
#
# We currently *support* up to 20 VPN client credentials. If you'd
# like more, raising the limit might even work!  20 is conservative,
# 50 is probably OK.  If you'd like to help us increase it, success
# stories at https://github.com/StreisandEffect/discussions would be
# nice. We can raise the limit after sufficient testing with each of
# the VPN types.
#
# Places you'll run into trouble if you use more:
#
# * Generated documentation will become unwieldy.
#
# * OpenVPN, OpenConnect, and WireGuard each use /24 networks
#   internally. Addresses 0, 1, and 255 are unavailable, leaving 253
#   remaining.
#
#   o  OpenVPN and OpenConnect dynamically allocate addresses, so
#      that's just a limit on concurrent users.
#
#   o  WireGuard permanently associates an IP address per client
#      credential, so that's a hard limit of 253 generated
#      certificates.
#
# * Generated client names are not checked/generated for
#   uniqueness. (This will be fixed.)  Duplicates will cause
#   mysterious failures. At 20 generated names, this essentially
#   doesn't happen, but because of the birthday paradox, 200 users
#   gives odds of 0.5%, I think.
#
# * There may be other resource exhaustion issues with large numbers
#   of concurrent users.
#
#   Protocols like SSH and Shadowsocks don't have per-user
#   credentials, so changing vpn_clients doesn't affect them. However,
#   the vpn_clients value is our guess for what's safe for them.
#
#   Streisand operates over difficult-to-debug networks. The
#   possibility of resource exhaustion may make troubleshooting other
#   problems harder.
#
# Summary: When reporting problems, please try to reproduce them with
# vpn_clients set to 20 or less. 50 is probably fine. 254 will fail to
# deploy.
