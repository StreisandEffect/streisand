### Linux ###
Download [shadowsocks2-linux-x64.gz](/mirror/shadowsocks/) and extract it:

    `gunzip shadowsocks2-linux-x64.gz`

Make the binary executable:

    `chmod +x shadowsocks2-linux-x64`

Start the shadowsocks SOCKS proxy:

    `./shadowsocks2-linux-x64 -c {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}:{{ shadowsocks_server_port }} -password "{{ shadowsocks_password.stdout }}" -socks localhost:{{ shadowsocks_local_port }} -verbose -cipher {{ shadowsocks_encryption_method }}`

For reference, this is the configuration specified:

        Server: {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}
        Port: {{ shadowsocks_server_port }}
        Password: {{ shadowsocks_password.stdout }}
        Encryption Method: {{ shadowsocks_encryption_method }}

Once you have Shadowsocks running locally, you'll need to forward your browser traffic through the SOCKS proxy it provides

### Testing with Curl

You can quickly test using curl:

     `curl -I --socks5 localhost:1080 google.com`

This should return a 301 Found response **not** a connection refused error.

#### Configuring Firefox to connect through a SOCKS proxy ####
1. Click the *Menu* button next to the *Home* icon to the right of the address bar.
1. Click *Options*.
1. Click the *Advanced* icon.
1. Go to the *Network* tab.
1. Click the *Settings* button to *Configure how Firefox connects to the Internet*.
1. Choose *Manual proxy configuration*.
1. Enter `127.0.0.1` and Port `{{ shadowsocks_local_port }}` on the *SOCKS Host* line.
1. Select *Remote DNS*. This configures Firefox to send all DNS requests through the SOCKS proxy. This will protect you against DNS poisoning and ensure that false DNS entries cannot be used to censor your access.
1. Click *OK*.
1. Click *OK* again to close the Firefox preferences window.
1. You should be good to go! You can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by [looking up your IP address on DuckDuckGo]({{ streisand_my_ip_url }}). It should say *Your public IP address is {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}*.

### simple-obfs for unreliable/hostile networks ###
For users on unreliable or hostile networks (esp. experiencing quality-of-service (QOS) throttling) using the simple-obfs plugin may help alleviate these issues. Further configuration of the Shadowsocks client to use the simple-obfs plugin can be carried out via the following configuration:

        Server: {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}
        Port: {{ shadowsocks_server_port }}
        Password: {{ shadowsocks_password.stdout }}
        Encryption Method: {{ shadowsocks_encryption_method }}
        Plugin: {{ shadowsocks_client_obfs_plugin }}
        Plugin_Options: {{ shadowsocks_obfs_client_plugin_opts }}

Android users will first need to download the [Simple Obfuscation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.shadowsocks.plugin.obfs_local&hl=en) plugin app, and then modify the existing Streisand profile on your client to use this plugin. You can do this by hitting the edit button next to the profile, tapping the `Plugin` option at the bottom of the profile and selecting the "Simple obsfucation" plugin from the menu. Your Shadowsocks traffic will now be obfuscated as `{{ shadowsocks_obfs_cover_protocol }}` traffic to `{{ shadowsocks_obfs_cover_domain }}`.
