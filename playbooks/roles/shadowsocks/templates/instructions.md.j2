### Linux ###
Download and compile the Shadowsocks [source code](/mirror/#shadowsocks), or install it via pip:

   `pip install shadowsocks`
   
Here is the configuration information that you'll need:

        Server: {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}
        Port: {{ shadowsocks_server_port }}
        Password: {{ shadowsocks_password.stdout }}
        Encryption Method: {{ shadowsocks_encryption_method }}
        One-time Authentication: {{ shadowsocks_enable_ota }}

Once you have Shadowsocks running locally, you'll need to forward your browser traffic through the SOCKS proxy it provides.

#### Configuring Firefox to connect through a SOCKS proxy ####
1. Click the *Menu* button next to the *Home* icon to the right of the address bar.
1. Click *Options*.
1. Click the *Advanced* icon.
1. Go to the *Network* tab.
1. Click the *Settings* button to *Configure how Firefox connects to the Internet*.
1. Choose *Manual proxy configuration*.
1. Enter `127.0.0.1` and Port `{{ shadowsocks_local_port }}` on the *SOCKS Host* line.
1. Select *Remote DNS*. This configures Firefox to send all DNS requests through the SOCKS proxy. This will protect you against DNS poisoning and ensure that false DNS entries cannot be used to censor your access.
1. Click *OK*.
1. Click *OK* again to close the Firefox preferences window.
1. You should be good to go! You can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by [looking up your IP address on Google](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ip%20address). It should say *Your public IP address is {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}*.
