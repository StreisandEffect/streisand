# This directory is used to create ACME challenge responses when using letsencrypt.
# N.B.: this should be different from streisand's gateway path to avoid any
# chance of leaking gateway files (VPN credentials, configs, etc.) over port 80.
# The nginx rules do redirect http to https, with the only exception
# being requests to /.well-known/acme-challenge for letsencrypt.
# So there is probably a low risk of that ever happening,
# but still, keeping them separate can't hurt.
