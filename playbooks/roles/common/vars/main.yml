# By default concurrent executions of `iptables` will fail immediately if unable
# to acquire a lock. We use the `--wait` argument to instead specify a maximum
# number of seconds to wait before failing. This allows multiple services to add
# iptables rules at once. See Issue #950 for longer term ideas on how to make
# this var not required.

# NOTE(@cpu): using the "folded block scalar" YAML syntax in the
# `streisand_word_gen` entries seems to be the best way to both:
#   a) split up the long command lines
#   b) use templated variables like {{ striesand_shuf }}.
# It has the unfortunate downside of leaving a trailing `\n` in the var content
# which can cause problems in usage like:
#  `shell: {{ streisand_word_gen.identifier }} > foo`
# The work-around/solution is to use:
#  `shell: {{ streisand_word_gen.identifier | trim }} > foo`
# If you, clever reader, have a better idea please open a PR! :-)
