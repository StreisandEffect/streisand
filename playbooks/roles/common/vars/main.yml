## Uncomment to set streisand_cn_name to the domain name of your server (eg, vpn.example.com),
## if you don't want to use the IP address. This can be useful for servers that change their IP,
## because you don't have to distribute new certificates. You will need to set a DNS entry to your
## Streisand server before accessing it.
