# By default concurrent executions of `iptables` will fail immediately if unable
# to acquire a lock. We use the `--wait` argument to instead specify a maximum
# number of seconds to wait before failing. This allows multiple services to add
# iptables rules at once. See Issue #950 for longer term ideas on how to make
# this var not required.
