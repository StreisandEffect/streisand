# NOTE(@nop): From wireguard/tasks/main.yml:
# NOTE(@cpu): We don't use a `notify` to "Restart dnsmasq" here because it seems
# that in some conditions Ansible mistakenly believes the dnsmasq restart can be
# skipped. We also don't use "reloaded" instead of "restarted" here because
# dnsmasq doesn't seem to reload _new_ config files in that case, just existing
# ones. A full restart is required in practice (sigh)
