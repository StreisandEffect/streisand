# Adapted from the "Modern" configuration detailed on the Mozilla Security
# Guidelines wiki (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Guidelines/OpenSSH).
#
# Three notable changes were made from that initial configuration:
# 1) All logs are disabled.
# 2) Root logins are allowed. This is the default way that most users
#    connect to a new VPS. Brute-force attacks against the root user
#    are mitigated because public-key authentication is required.
# 3) PAM support is enabled.
