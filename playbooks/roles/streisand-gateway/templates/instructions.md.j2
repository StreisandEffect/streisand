SSL Certificate Installation
----------------------------
You should install the Gateway's SSL certificate so your browser can automatically verify the integrity of the connection. This prevents anyone from tampering with your traffic and also protects your login credentials. The certificate has been embedded directly into this HTML file, and you can download it here:
<p><a download="{{ streisand_ipv4_address }}.crt" id="download" href="data:application/x-x509-ca-cert;base64,{{ streisand_certificate_data_uri.stdout }}">Download Certificate</a></p>

<a name="ssl-manual"></a>
### Manual SSL Verification ###
*The manual certificate verification option is significantly less secure than installing the certificate using one of the methods above. Your browser will display a warning message, and you are more vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks because the fingerprints must be verified on every connection attempt. It should be used with great care, and only as a last resort.*

The certificate details should match the following information:

##### Serial Number #####
`{{ ssl_certificate_serial_number.stdout }}`

##### Fingerprints #####
{% for fingerprint in ssl_certificate_fingerprints.results %}
    {{ fingerprint.stdout }}
{% endfor %}

If everything checks out, you are ready to connect. See [Connecting to your Streisand Gateway](#connecting-ssl).
