WireGuard
---------

If you are a Linux user, [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) is almost certainly the best connection option that Streisand provides. This is due to its [incredible performance](https://www.wireguard.com/performance/), [class-leading cryptography](https://www.wireguard.com/protocol/), and many, many other benefits.

WireGuard is currently only available for Linux, but [cross-platform](https://www.wireguard.com/xplatform/) and portable implementations are under active development.

### Linux ###
1. [Install WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/install/)
1. Download one of the client configuration files. **Only one computer can use a profile at a time**. For this example we'll assume you downloaded {{ vpn_client_names.results[0].stdout }}:
{% for client in vpn_client_names.results %}
   * [{{ client.stdout }}](/wireguard/{{ client.stdout }}.client.conf)
{% endfor %}
1. Rename the downloaded client configuration:

  `mv ~/Downloads/{{ vpn_client_names.results[0].stdout }}.client.conf ~/Downloads/wg0-client.conf`
1. Set permissions on the client configuration file:

   `sudo chown -v root:root ~/Downloads/wg0-client.conf; sudo chmod -v 600 ~/Downloads/wg0-client.conf`
1. Move the client configuration file into the correct directory:

   `sudo mv -i -v ~/Downloads/wg0-client.conf /etc/wireguard/`
1. Use the `wg-quick` utility to bring up the WireGuard interface:

   `sudo wg-quick up wg0-client`

1. For Linux systems using systemd you can also enable Wireguard at boot:

   'sudo systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0-client.service'

1. You should be good to go! You can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by [looking up your IP address on DuckDuckGo]({{ streisand_my_ip_url }}). It should say *Your public IP address is {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}*.
1. To stop routing your traffic through WireGuard, simply bring the interface back down:

   `sudo wg-quick down wg0-client`

#### A note on DNS configuration ####
Each client configuration profile includes a `DNS` command that uses resolvconf to direct DNS traffic to the dnsmasq server that is available via the WireGuard encrypted interface at `{{ dnsmasq_wireguard_ip }}`. Although resolvconf is a common utility, you may need to use `PostUp`/`PostDown` with a different command for your distribution or particular network configuration.
