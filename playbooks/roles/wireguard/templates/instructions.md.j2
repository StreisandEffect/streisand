WireGuard
---------

If you are a Linux user, [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.io/) is almost certainly the best connection option that Streisand provides. This is due to its [incredible performance](https://www.wireguard.io/performance/), [class-leading cryptography](https://www.wireguard.io/protocol/), and many, many other benefits.

WireGuard is currently only available for Linux, but [cross-platform](https://www.wireguard.io/xplatform/) and portable implementations are under active development.

### Linux ###
1. [Install WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.io/install/)
1. Download the client configuration file:
   * [wg0-client.conf](/wireguard/wg0-client.conf)
1. Set permissions on the client configuration file:

   `sudo chown -v root:root ~/Downloads/wg0-client.conf; sudo chmod -v 600 ~/Downloads/wg0-client.conf`
1. Move the client configuration file into the correct directory:

   `sudo mv -i -v ~/Downloads/wg0-client.conf /etc/wireguard/`
1. Use the `wg-quick` utility to bring up the WireGuard interface:

   `sudo wg-quick up wg0-client`
1. You should be good to go! You can verify that your traffic is being routed properly by [looking up your IP address on Google](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ip%20address). It should say *Your public IP address is {{ streisand_ipv4_address }}*.
1. To stop routing your traffic through WireGuard, simply bring the interface back down:

   `sudo wg-quick down wg0-client`

#### A note on DNS configuration ####
The `wg0-client.conf` file includes simple `PostUp` and `PostDown` commands that use resolvconf to direct DNS traffic to the dnsmasq server that is available via the WireGuard encrypted interface at `{{ dnsmasq_wireguard_ip }}`. Although resolvconf is a common utility, you may need to modify these lines for your distribution or particular network configuration.
