# Explicitly listen on localhost. This is required since config fragments in
# `/etc/dnsmasq.d` may add additional `listen-address` values and the man page
# says:
#   Note that if no --interface option is given, but --listen-address is,
#   dnsmasq will not automatically listen on the loopback interface. To achieve
#   this, its IP address, 127.0.0.1, must be explicitly given as
#   a --listen-address option.
listen-address=127.0.0.1

# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
domain-needed

# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.

# If you don't want dnsmasq to read /etc/resolv.conf or any other
# file, getting its servers from this file instead (see below), then
# uncomment this.
