        Do you have a fully qualified domain pointed at your Streisand server?

        This is an optional question. If you have a domain that points to your
        Streisand server, the installation scripts can request a Let's Encrypt
        HTTPS certificate for you automatically.  If you do not provide one or
        the request fails, a self-signed certificate will be used instead.

        If you have just created a new cloud server in previous steps now is a
        good time to point your fully qualified domain to your server's public
        address. Make sure the fully qualified domain resolves to the correct IP
        address before proceeding.

        Please type your fully qualified domain below. Press enter to skip.

      prompt: |
        Which email address do you want to use as a contact for the Streisand
        server's Let's Encrypt certificate?

        This is an optional question. If you supply an email address Let's
        Encrypt will send you important (but infrequent) notifications about
        your certificate. These messages include any upcoming certificate
        expirations, and important changes to the Let's Encrypt service.
        The email provided will not be used for anything else or shared with the
        Streisand developers.

        Please type your contact email below. Press enter to skip.
