# lets-encrypt.yml asks questions about Streisand instance domain name, which
# is used to request TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt. If user fails to
# answer these questions, lets-encrypt role would not be run, and self-signed
# certificates are generated and used instead.

        Which domain do you want to use to host Streisand server?

        This is an optional question. If you have a domain that points to your
        Streisand server, the installation scripts can request Let's Encrypt
        HTTPS certificates for you automatically.  If you do not provide one or
        the request fails, self-signed certificates will be used instead.

        If you have just created a new cloud server in previous steps, it is
        good time to point your domain to your server's public address, as DNS
        changes take time to propagate.

        Please type your domain below. Press enter to skip.

    - name: "streisand_admin_email_var"
      prompt: |
        Which email address do you want to use as contact for the Streisand
        server's Let's Encrypt certificate?

        This is an optional question. If you supply an email address, Let's
        Encrypt will send you important (but very infrequent) notifications
        about using the certificate. This mail includes any upcoming certificate
        expirations, and important changes to the Let's Encrypt service.
        The email will not be used for anything else.
