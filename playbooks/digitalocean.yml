          Personal Access Tokens allow Streisand to create a droplet for you.
          New Personal Access Tokens can be generated in the DigitalOcean control panel.
          To generate a new token please do the following:
                * Go to https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications
                * Click 'Generate New Token'
                * Give the token a name (it is arbitrary)
                * Be sure to select the 'Write' scope as well (this is not optional)
                * Click 'Generate Token'
                * Copy the long string that is generated and paste it below.
          If this field is left blank, the environment variable DO_API_KEY will be used.

You cannot upload multiple\n    keys that have the same value under different names.\n\n    If you see an error that says 'SSH Key failed to be created' once the setup\n    process starts, then this is the problem. You can retry the setup process\n    using the name of the existing SSH key from the DigitalOcean control panel\n    that matches the contents of your RSA public key.\n"
