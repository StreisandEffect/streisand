Streisand
=========

**Silence censorship. Automate the [effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect).**

The Internet can be a little unfair. It's way too easy for ISPs, telecoms, politicians, and corporations to block access to the sites and information that you care about. But breaking through these restrictions is *tough*. Or is it?

If there is something that you think Streisand should do, or if you find a bug in its documentation or execution, please file a report on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand/issues).
