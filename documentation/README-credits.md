[Jason A. Donenfeld](https://www.zx2c4.com/) deserves a lot of credit for being brave enough to reimagine what a modern VPN should look like and for coming up with something as good as [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/). He has our sincere thanks for all of his patient help and high-quality feedback.

We are grateful to [Trevor Smith](https://github.com/trevorsmith) for his massive contributions. He suggested the Gateway approach, provided tons of invaluable feedback, made *everything* look better, and developed the HTML template that served as the inspiration to take things to the next level before Streisand's public release.

Huge thanks to [Paul Wouters](https://nohats.ca/) of [The Libreswan Project](https://libreswan.org/) for his generous help troubleshooting the L2TP/IPsec setup.

[Starcadian's](http://starcadian.com/) 'Sunset Blood' album was played on repeat approximately 300 times during the first few months of work on the project in early 2014.
