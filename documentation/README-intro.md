Introducing Streisand
---------------------
* A single command sets up a brand new Ubuntu 16.04 server running a [wide variety of anti-censorship software](#services-provided) that can completely mask and encrypt all of your Internet traffic.
* Streisand natively supports the creation of new servers at [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/), and [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/)&mdash;with more providers coming soon! It also runs on any Ubuntu 16.04 server regardless of provider, and **hundreds** of instances can be configured simultaneously using this method.
* The process is completely automated and only takes about ten minutes, which is pretty awesome when you consider that it would require the average system administrator several days of frustration to set up even a small subset of what Streisand offers in its out-of-the-box configuration.
* Once your Streisand server is running, you can give the custom connection instructions to friends, family members, and fellow activists. The connection instructions contain an embedded copy of the server's unique SSL certificate, so you only have to send them a single file.
* Each server is entirely self-contained and comes with absolutely everything that users need to get started, including cryptographically verified mirrors of all common clients. This renders any attempted censorship of default download locations completely ineffective.
* But wait, there's more...
