# Some providers (e.g. Amazon EC2) assign internal 172.x.x.x IP
# addresses to their virtual machines. It's important to use the real
# public IP in the instructions Streisand generates, because the
# internal addresses are not publicly accessible.
#
# Some providers (e.g. Amazon EC2 and Linode) do not use the name that
# is provided in the API call as the server's hostname. It's important
# to use the friendly name in the instructions rather than an ugly,
# randomly generated hostname.
#
# Each 'genesis' role for the providers that Streisand natively supports
# sets the streisand_ipv4_address and streisand_server_name variables in
# an attempt to correct the limitations laid out above. However, it is
# also necessary to fall back to default sane values if users choose to
# run Streisand on their own servers or against other cloud providers.
#
# These conditionals are here for that very reason :)
